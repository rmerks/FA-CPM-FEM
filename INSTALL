----------------------

Elisabeth G. Rens and Roeland M.H. Merks. Cell Shape and Durotaxis Follow from Mechanical Cell-Substrate Reciprocity and Focal Adhesion Dynamics: A Multiscale Mathematical Model. PNAS.

Please cite our paper if you use or build upon this code.

Using the code requires basic knowledge of programming, compiling and using the command line. 

INSTALLATION
------------
This code is written in C++. The visualization makes use of the Qt5-library. It runs from the commandline and should run on any platform. It has been tested on Linux and MacOSX.

To install, first install a C++ compiler, Qt5 and git. Qt Creator comes with a GNU C++ compiler built in. Download the open source version of Qt. Make sure you check 'command line tools' during installation.

Note that to use the FA-CPM-FEM code, you must make use of the open source version of Qt.  Any derivatives of this simulation code will be open source too.

To start, checkout the source code from GitHub, if you have not already done so:

https://github.com/rmerks/FA-CPM-FEM.git

Next, after downloading the FA-CPM-FEM source code, on the commandline move into the FA-CPM-FEM code (i.e., type 'cd FA-CPM-FEM'). 

Then type:

qmake [enter]
make [enter]

If the system cannot find 'qmake', please check if qmake is in your path. For example, on our MacOSX system qmake is located in /opt/Qt/5.12.1/clang_64/bin/. Either add the folder to your path, or type the full path to qmake.  


USAGE
-----
After compilation, there will be an executable called 'CPMFEM' in folder FA-CPM-FEM. The folder "PARAMETERS" contains parameter files for all the individual simulations shown in the paper; the scripts used for the parameter sweeps can be obtained on request from the authors. 

To run a simulation, type './CPMFEM' followed by the name of the folder in which the parameters are residing. It is important that you include a slash (/) after the name of the folder. E.g., 

./CPMFEM PARAMETERS/Fig2A/Fig2A-5kPa/

The output will be stored in the same folder. Output consists of PNG images, and textfiles containing information about the cell shape, focal adhesion sizes, and so forth.

*Anisotropy*
To run the anistropic simulations shown in the supplements, check out branch 'withnoise' from GitHub, as follows:
1. Commit any changes that you may have made to the code that you want to keep:
git commit -am "[description of changes]"
2. Check out branch "withnoise":
git checkout withnoise.
3. Recompile as described above.


DATA ANALYSIS
------------
To analyse the data from a parameter sweep, we make use of matlab scripts in DataAnalysisinMatlab/
these matlab scripts make use of the specific functions provided in DataAnalysisinMatlab/functions

Note that when reproduction is necessary, the right folder paths, parameters and ranges should be chosen selected within these files
