This code is part of: 
----------------------

Elisabeth G. Rens and Roeland M.H. Merks. Cell Shape and Durotaxis Follow from Mechanical Cell-Substrate Reciprocity and Focal Adhesion Dynamics: A Multiscale Mathematical Model. PNAS.xÂ§
Next, after downloading the FA-CPM-FEM source code, on the commandline move into the FA-CPM-FEM code (i.e., type 'cd FA-CPM-FEM'). 

Then type:

qmake [enter]
make [enter]

If the system cannot find 'qmake', please check if qmake is in your path. For example, on our MacOSX system qmake is located in /opt/Qt/5.12.1/clang_64/bin/. Either add the folder to your path, or type the full path to qmake.  


USAGE
-----
After compilation, there will be an executable called 'CPMFEM' in folder FA-CPM-FEM. The folder "PARAMETERS" contains parameter files for all the individual simulations shown in the paper; the scripts used for the parameter sweeps can be obtained on request from the authors. 

To run a simulation, type './CPMFEM' followed by the name of the folder in which the parameters are residing. It is important that you include a slash (/) after the name of the folder. E.g., 

./CPMFEM PARAMETERS/Fig2A/Fig2A-5kPa/

The output will be stored in the same folder. Output consists of PNG images, and textfiles containing information about the cell shape, focal adhesion sizes, and so forth.

*Anisotropy*
To run the anistropic simulations shown in the supplements, check out branch 'withnoise' from GitHub, as follows:
1. Commit any changes that you may have made to the code that you want to keep:
git commit -am "[description of changes]"
2. Check out branch "withnoise":
git checkout withnoise.
3. Recompile as described above.


DATA ANALYSIS
------------
To analyse the data from a parameter sweep, we make use of matlab scripts in DataAnalysisinMatlab/
these matlab scripts make use of the specific functions provided in DataAnalysisinMatlab/functions

Note that when reproduction is necessary, the right folder paths, parameters and ranges should be chosen selected within these files
